# GPSAFE

Hi, I'm Davi Sobrinho Labre, and I'm a analysis and systems development student in Universidade Católica de Brasília, this app named GPSAFE was developed, minded and designed by me and was created in the 1° semester of 2022 as a part of one own objective( to help my father who have a tracker business) and also as a classwork for my university.

The app GPSAFE was developed in Kotlin and works in any Android 8.0 or higher, it is a CRUD of costumers and works as a virtual notepad designed for my father business, the goal is to add new quick and math widgets that will also help my father with the finances and make his management a bit more agile.
